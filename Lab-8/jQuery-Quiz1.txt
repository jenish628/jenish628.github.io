1. In jQuery terminology, what is the difference between the “jQuery function” and the “jQuery object”?

====> The jQuery function is the set of statements that performs specific task when called.  The jQuery function creates the jQuery objects.
The shorthand of the jQuery function is the $ sign with parenthesis. ie:- I usually refer to it as $()

jQuery Object is an object representing the elements of the jQuery set. It contains a selector, context and length.

2. Write jQuery code to find all h1 elements that are children of a div element and make their background
color red.

Sample HTML:
<body>
<h1>abc</h1><br><div>
 <h1>div-1</h1>
 <h1>div-2</h1>
 </div>
 <h1>xyz</h1>
</body>

====>  $("div").children("h1").css({color: "red"});


3. Use a jQuery method to insert the text "YES!" at the end of the <p> element.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script>
<!—INSERT YOUR JQUERY CODE HERE - - >

====>  $("p").append("YES")

</script>
</head>
<body>
<p>Is jQuery FUN or what? </p>
</body>
</html>
