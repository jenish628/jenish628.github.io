        <h1> CSE 190 M Fifteen Puzzle </h1>
        <p>
            The goal of the fifteen puzzle is to un-jumble its fifteen squares 
            by repeatedly making moves that slide squares into the empty space. 
            How quickly can you solve it?
        </p>

            American puzzle author and mathematician Sam Loyd is often falsely credited with creating the puzzle; indeed, 
            Loyd claimed from 1891 until his death in 1911 that he invented it. The puzzle was actually created around 1874 
            by Noyes Palmer Chapman, a postmaster in Canastota, New York.
